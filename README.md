# Camel ALNA Protein Quantification paper
Those scripts were used for paper "Proteomic analysis reveals similarity of expression profile in aggregated lymphoid nodules area in abomasum with Peyerâ€™s patches of Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus)".

1. Quality_control.Rmd
This script has been used to plot the quality of data.

2. Immune_protein_camel.Rmd
Using human database we can mark the immune-related gene in camel according to the genes from the same orthologs.

3. Quantitation.Rmd
This script reads and filtered the quantification data. Then, the cleaned data has been analyzed by comparing different groups.

5. Pathway_analysis.Rmd
This is the script for pathway enrichment analysis.
